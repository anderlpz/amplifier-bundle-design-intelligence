# Writing Principles: Human Agency and Care

## Core Principle

**Write with people in sentences.** Every statement should have a human agent—someone doing something, making decisions, experiencing outcomes. Avoid abstract, agentless constructions that hide human action behind passive voice or anthropomorphized concepts.

## The Problem: Agentless Corporate Jargon

LLM-generated content often produces grammatically correct but meaningless sentences that remove human agency:

### ❌ Avoid: Agentless Writing
- "Maintenance explodes and speed disappears"
- "Complexity increases and productivity decreases" 
- "The system scales and performance improves"
- "Innovation accelerates and adoption grows"

**Why this fails:**
- Can maintenance actually *do* anything?
- Who is experiencing these changes?
- What human decisions led to these outcomes?
- Punishes the reader with empty abstractions

## The Solution: Human-Centered Writing

### ✅ Aim for: Writing with Human Agency

Transform abstract statements by inserting the humans:

| Agentless | Human-Centered |
|-----------|---------------|
| "Maintenance explodes" | "Teams spend 80% of their time fixing bugs" |
| "Speed disappears" | "Developers wait hours for builds to complete" |
| "Complexity increases" | "Engineers struggle to understand the codebase" |
| "The system scales" | "Your team can handle 10x more users without adding servers" |
| "Innovation accelerates" | "Designers ship new features in days instead of months" |

## Essential Elements

### 1. Human Subjects
Every sentence should answer: **Who is doing/experiencing this?**

- Users
- Teams
- Designers
- Developers
- Stakeholders
- Your organization

### 2. Concrete Actions
Replace abstract verbs with specific human actions:

| Abstract | Concrete |
|----------|----------|
| "occurs" | "happens to your team" |
| "enables" | "lets designers..." |
| "facilitates" | "helps developers..." |
| "optimizes" | "reduces the time your team spends..." |

### 3. Tangible Outcomes
Make outcomes real and measurable from a human perspective:

| Abstract | Tangible |
|----------|----------|
| "improved performance" | "pages load in under 2 seconds for users on mobile" |
| "increased efficiency" | "designers complete designs 3x faster" |
| "better maintainability" | "new developers understand the code in days, not months" |

## Care as Practice

> "It could be uplifting to watch a person energetically building a beautiful coffin. And depressing to watch someone sloppily and carelessly make the worst birthday cake ever." — George Saunders

**Care shows in:**
- **Word choice**: Precise language over corporate buzzwords
- **Structure**: Clear flow that respects the reader's time
- **Voice**: Active, human-centered sentences
- **Purpose**: Every word earns its place

**Carelessness shows in:**
- Generic, interchangeable phrases
- Passive constructions hiding responsibility
- Abstract concepts floating without human connection
- Sentences that sound "AI-written"

## Practical Application

### Writing Design Documentation

❌ **Agentless:**
> "The component library ensures consistency and speeds up development cycles."

✅ **Human-centered:**
> "Your designers use the same components across every screen, so users see familiar patterns. Your developers ship features faster because they're assembling proven pieces instead of coding from scratch."

### Writing Technical Guidance

❌ **Agentless:**
> "Performance optimization occurs through caching implementation and bundle size reduction."

✅ **Human-centered:**
> "Cache the data your users access most. Split your JavaScript bundles so visitors download only what they need. These changes help users on slow connections load your app in seconds instead of waiting minutes."

### Writing About Systems

❌ **Agentless:**
> "The system architecture enables scalability and maintains reliability under load."

✅ **Human-centered:**
> "When your traffic spikes during a product launch, your servers automatically spin up more capacity. Your team sleeps through the night instead of getting paged at 3am."

## Questions to Ask

Before publishing any content, ask:

1. **Who is doing this?** Can I name the human agent?
2. **What are they actually doing?** Can I use a concrete verb?
3. **Why does this matter to them?** What human outcome results?
4. **Would I say this in conversation?** Or does it sound like corporate-speak?
5. **Did I care enough?** Did I put effort into making this clear and useful?

## Application in Design Intelligence

When the design agents generate content:

### In Specifications
- Name the designers, developers, and users
- Describe what they do, not what "the system" does
- Connect every technical decision to human outcomes

### In Documentation
- Write as if explaining to a colleague
- Use "you" and "your team" liberally
- Replace abstractions with specific scenarios

### In Recommendations
- Show the human impact of each choice
- Describe who benefits and how
- Make trade-offs visible in human terms

## Remember

**Your ideas deserve your best effort, and people deserve to be in your understanding of how the world works.**

Forces we describe are not abstract, isolated, or alien. They are people, for good and ill. Write like you know this.
