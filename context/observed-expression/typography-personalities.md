# Typography Personalities: What Fonts Communicate

**Purpose:** This document provides metacognitive understanding of typography expression - what fonts *mean*, not just what they *are*. Use this to inform typography decisions that align with user vision and emotional intent.

**Status:** Curated knowledge - will evolve as research observations accumulate

## The Expression Framework

Typography is not decoration. It's the visual voice of content. Every typeface carries emotional weight, cultural associations, and psychological signals. Understanding these helps translate user vision ("I want it to feel premium") into specific typography decisions.

### The Three Layers of Typography Expression

1. **Classification** (what it is) - Serif, sans-serif, monospace, display
2. **Personality** (what it feels like) - Warm, cold, authoritative, playful
3. **Context** (what it means here) - Brand voice, user expectations, cultural fit

This document focuses on layer 2: personality.
