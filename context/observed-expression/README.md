# Observed Expression

**Purpose:** Curated knowledge about what design elements *communicate*, not just what they *are*.

This directory contains metacognitive design intelligence - the understanding of expression, meaning, and emotional communication in design. Unlike the `knowledge-base/` directory (which covers technical foundations), this directory focuses on the *why* and *what it means*.

## Contents

### typography-personalities.md
Understanding what fonts communicate - the emotional weight, cultural associations, and psychological signals of different typefaces. Helps translate user vision ("premium but warm") into specific typography decisions.

## Philosophy

**Design decisions are communication decisions.**

When a user says "I want it to feel premium," they're not asking for specific pixels - they're describing an emotional outcome. This directory builds the bridge between emotional intent and design execution.

### The Three-Layer Model

1. **Technical knowledge** (knowledge-base/) - What it is, how it works
2. **Expression knowledge** (observed-expression/) - What it communicates, what it means
3. **Research observations** (archive/) - What's working now, what's emerging

This directory is layer 2 - the metacognitive understanding that transforms technical capability into meaningful expression.

## Future Additions

Planned topics (to be developed as the bundle evolves):

- **color-psychology.md** - What colors communicate beyond theory
- **spacing-rhythm.md** - How spatial relationships express hierarchy and flow
- **motion-emotion.md** - What animation styles communicate
- **layout-narratives.md** - How structure tells stories

## Relationship to Research

The `archive/` directory captures *what's happening now* in design through automated research. This directory captures *what things mean* - the interpretation layer.

As research observations accumulate, they should:
1. Validate assumptions in this directory
2. Surface new patterns to document
3. Provide examples to reference

## Community Notes

This is foundational knowledge that benefits from:
- Additional font personality analysis
- Regional/cultural expression variations
- Accessibility-focused expression patterns
- Industry-specific communication norms

Contributions welcome to expand and refine these metacognitive resources.
