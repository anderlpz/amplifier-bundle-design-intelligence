# Cognitive Task Catalog

> **Purpose**: Quick reference for mapping design problems to analogous domains through cognitive task analysis.

---

## How to Use This Catalog

1. **Identify the cognitive task** the user needs to perform
2. **Look up analogous domains** where this task is well-solved
3. **Research across those domains** for proven patterns
4. **Abstract the interaction/cognitive patterns** (not just visuals)
5. **Synthesize with reasoning** about why each source is relevant

---

### Real-Time Monitoring
**Definition**: Tracking continuously changing data with awareness of change rate and direction.

**Analogous Domains**:
- Stock tickers (price movement)
- Live sports scores (game state)
- Social media feeds (activity streams)
- System logs (event streams)
- Heart rate monitors (vital trends)
- Traffic maps (congestion changes)

**Key Patterns**:
- Change indicators (arrows, delta values, trends)
- Rate of change (not just current value)
- Historical context (where we came from)
- Auto-refresh patterns (when/how to update)
- Alert thresholds (when to interrupt)

---

### Comparative Analysis
**Definition**: Understanding similarities and differences between multiple entities.

**Analogous Domains**:
- Product comparison tools (feature matrices)
- A/B testing dashboards (variant comparison)
- Medical imaging (before/after, side-by-side)
- Code diff tools (change identification)

- How to fix it (specific action)
- Context (what's normal, how far off are we)
- Prevention (how to avoid in future)

## Using This Catalog

### For Discovery Phase
When interviewing users, map their needs to cognitive tasks:
- "When you use this, what decisions do you make?" → Decision Support
- "How do you know if something's wrong?" → Anomaly Detection
- "How do you track progress?" → Timeline/Progress Understanding

### For Research Phase
For each cognitive task identified:
1. Look up analogous domains in this catalog
2. Research the BEST examples from those domains (not just first results)
3. Focus on domains that seem unexpected but solve the task well
4. Extract patterns at Level 3-4 (interaction/cognitive, not visual)

### For Design Phase
When synthesizing research:
- Reference the cognitive task explicitly ("This pattern solves rapid assessment")
- Explain WHY the cross-domain pattern is relevant
- Abstract the principle, not copy the implementation
- Adapt to your context (don't cargo cult)

---

## Expanding This Catalog

As you encounter new cognitive tasks or discover excellent analogous domains:
1. Add them to this catalog
2. Document why the domain is relevant
3. Identify the key patterns that transfer
4. Note what makes this domain particularly strong at this task
